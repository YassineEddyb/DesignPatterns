- Identify the aspects of you application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to an Interface, not to an Implimintation
- Favor Composition over Inheritance
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. 
- Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends.
- The Hollywood Principle: Don’t call us, we’ll call you.
